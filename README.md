 I am at my best in a job where I can work with other people, but also have thechance to concentrate in privacy, and have some level of both independence andcollaboration in decision-making. I also am confident and succeed in performingcomplex tasks and processes within a tight schedule, and hectic and varying worksuits me very well. Tasks where I have an opportunity to solve problems bring thebest out of me.
